# 🏠 Cozy Nest: Server Side 🏠
## Purpose and Target Audience
Cozy Nest is an interior design and decor application providing users structure when it comes to designing their space. Designing a new space or renovating an existing one is exciting, but people can oftentimes easily become inundated with the myriad of ideas and inspirations. This is where Cozy Nest comes in! You can add the specific rooms you want to design and the pieces you want in your rooms. This allows the user to keep an account of the rooms and pieces, while also being able to visualize the room and the associated pieces. This streamlines the home design process, giving users more clarity and peace of mind.

## Primary Features of Cozy Nest

* Google Authentication is required to gain access to Cozy Nest
  * Upon authentication, new user will be shown a form to fill out before accessing contents of the application
  * Landing page will provide users with images and descriptions of the 18 most popular interior design styles, allowing users to better determine what styles they may want to incorporate into their spaces

* Public view: 
  * All authenticated users can view rooms and pieces created by other authenticated users

* Rooms:
  * Authenticated users are able to create their a room/space
  * Authenticated users are able to edit and delete rooms they have created, but can only view rooms created by other authenticated users

## Begin Designing Your Own Cozy Nest!
**In order for Cozy Nest server side to work, you will need the client side repo, you can find it [here](https://github.com/krima-patel/CozyNest-FE). The server side API server and the client side must run simultaneously in order to access and use Cozy Nest. The instructions for how to run the client side locally can be found in the CozyNest-FE README.md.**

### Run Backend Locally:
These are the server side instructions for this application:
1. Clone CozyNest-BE to your local machine
git@github.com:krima-patel/CozyNest-BE.git

6. Seed the database with some sample data you can work with:
A quick and easy way to do this:
- Create a seed.sh file at the root of the project (should not be in any other folder within the project, it should be outside/be its own file)
- Add the following commands to the seed.sh file:
rm -rf cozynestapi/migrations
rm db.sqlite3
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py makemigrations cozynestapi
python manage.py migrate cozynestapi
python manage.py loaddata users
python manage.py loaddata rooms
python manage.py loaddata pieces
python manage.py loaddata styles
python manage.py loaddata piecestyles
- Run these commands by running two commands:
First, run "chmod +x seed.sh"
Then run "./seed.sh"
7. Now start your API server! Run this command:
python manage.py runserver
